# Nike-store-website
I've created a e-commerce Nike store website. I used a combination of HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and JavaScript to make it all possible.

This project was actually one of my first experiences with JavaScript, and I'm proud to see how far I've come since then. Here are some key features of the site:

User-friendly interface

Dark mode / light mode available

Responsive design that looks great on any device

I had a lot of fun building this project, and I hope you enjoy exploring the image gallery as much as I enjoyed creating it!ðŸ˜Š
